## DESCRIPTION:

### History

A clear language barrier has been evolving between Britain and the US over the years, and this gem hopes to help both sides of this barrier by translating some of the common phrases used on a daily basis by both sides.  Let's look at a timeline to describe the necessity of this gem.

- England rules the waves
- Some Spanish fella 'discovered' the America's
- Nuclear weapons were created
- The US became a super power
- The US forgot about everyone else

Now, this timeline is roughly accurate bar one major fact.  We're missing:

- Education was neglected, particularly in the spelling and grammar department

The common misconception is that there are two English languages.  Actually, there is on correct language and one mispronounced, incorrectly spelt one.  

Now, because the US has more nuclear weapons than us Brits, I have also included a yankify binary that will translate from British to Yank.
